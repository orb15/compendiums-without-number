# Compendiums Without Number

This software implements a "Compendium/Content" module for Foundry Virtual Table Top (ref: https://foundryvtt.com/).

The compendiums provided in this module target the Systemless game system (ref: https://github.com/orb15/systemless).
The Systemless system allows GM's and players to play any game system.
You cannot make use of this content without also using the Systemless system.

The contents in these compendiums are for Kevin Crawford's excellent "Without Number" games, including Stars Without Number (gritty far-future roleplaying), Worlds Without Number (fantasy roleplaying) and the newly-released Cities Without Number (cyberpunk roleplaying). 
You can learn more about these products at Sine Nomine Publishing (ref: https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com).
I strongly encourage you to check out these excellent rules systems.

Note that the Without Numbers rules are provided either free of charge (about 90-95% of all content for a rules system) and for a cost (all of the content from the free rules plus some added bonus content that enhances but by no means is required to run the game). 
If you have not read the free version of these rules, you really must do so.
The product quality is excellent.
Even if you do not find the rules useful, a substantial portion of each rules book is filled with useful GM'ing advice and tools, including: random tables, adventure seeds, oracles (for solo play) and the like.
This information can be used to enhance any game system or world.
You will NOT be disappointed.

# Changelog
The latest production version is listed at the top of the table.
Older versions are listed below the top row.
Note that Foundry Virtual Table Top (FVTT) often makes breaking changes between major versions (FVTT v9 -> v10 significantly changed the internal Data Model, for example) that necessitate some type of rework in this code.
Given this, this code is not strictly backward compatible to older versions of FVTT.
That is, a version of this system that has been tested to work on FVTT v9 will (very likely) not work on FVTT v10.
In general, you should use the tagged version of this software compatible with the version of FVTT and the version of Systemless you are running.

## Major and Minor Versions of this Software
Major version changes in this software do _not_ mean that this software itself is undergoing a breaking change.
This software will update it's major version when FVTT makes a major revision (going from FVTT v9 -> v10 for example).

This software will make minor version changes to add new features to a major version.

This software will make patch version changes to address defects or perform chores within a minor version.

## Changelog Updates
This Changelog wil be updated with each version change.
This Changelog will be periodically updated to reflect the latest version of FVTT and the Systemless system on which the Compendiums have been tested.
